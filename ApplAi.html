                            During school, you knew all the details you would go through, but the stage you are in now may have many things to you that are still unknown. That is why we would like you to take advantage of this opportunity and learn more.
                            Currently in 3 scenarios you are trapped in.
                            First: You know what computers and information are, and what is your goal, but you need to talk to people from the college who have more experience and information.
                            The second: It is one of your choices, but you cannot decide whether this is the right choice or not.
                            The third: You still do not know what you like and therefore do not know what to choose.
                            We hear a lot about top colleges, which now have computers and information as one of them.
                            Don't want to know why it is one of them?
                            Why is it in great demand in the labor market now?
                            So what is the difference between computer science and computer engineering? (This is the most common question that comes to our minds all)
                            You know that now computer science isn't only for math students but for science students too!! 
                            Because of all these questions, we decided to do this event in order to find answers to all these questions.
                            Ok, what will I benefit from this event, and what will it be? -
                            We will be with you through Lives, Posts and Videos to know</textarea>
